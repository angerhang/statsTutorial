Data importing is important. Although it can be done easily, sometimes it does give people a headache. We will be going through a few importing methods for several common data formats and talk about issues people might encounter.

#### Preparation 
Before you import your data set, you have to make sure that the data set is in your working directory. 
```{r eval=FALSE}
getwd()
```
tells you what is your working directory.
```{r eval=FALSE}
list.files()
```
will list the files available in your working directory.

In case you want to change your directory, use 
```{r eval=FALSE}
setwd("~/Desktop/")
# Set the working directory to your desktop
```

### Import Text 
`read.table` function is usually used for reading data in `txt` format, and again we will want to know what kind of separation symbol a file has in order to import the data without any error. If you look at [text1.txt](https://angerhang.github.io/statsWithR/src/chaper1/text1.txt) and [text2.txt](https://angerhang.github.io/statsWithR/src/chaper1/text2.txt), you will find the separation  symbol of the first one is a space but the second has `;` as the delimiter. In this case we shall import them differently:
```{r}
setwd("~/angerhang.github.io/statsWithR/src/chaper1/")
table1 <- read.table("text1.txt", header = T)
print(table1)
table2 <- read.table("text2.txt", sep = ";", header = T)
print(table2)
```
When the data file does not contain a header, we should simply omit the `header` argument in the function call. The header will be automatically generated for you using `V1`, `V2`, `V3`...... [text3.txt](https://angerhang.github.io/statsWithR/src/chaper1/text3.txt) is such a file that has no header.
```{r eval= FALSE}
table3 <- read.table("text3.txt")
```

### Import Excel 
There are two ways of importing an Excel with `.csv` extension, namely `read.csv()` and `read.csv2()`. The difference of these two is that for former one can properly import the Excel file that has comma `,` as the separator symbol, whereas, the latter can import the one that has semicolon `;` as the separator symbol.
```{r eval=FALSE}
test_csv = read.csv("test.csv")
test_csv = read.csv2("test.csv")
```

### Import SPSS 
When importing data in SPSS format having an extension of `sav`, we need to use the foreign package which comes with a set of commands that allows us to import data in different ways: 
```{r, eval=FALSE}
# install foreign package if you don't have it
install.packages("foreign") 
library(foreign)
spss_data = read.spss("test", to.data.frame = TRUE)
```

### Import SAS
```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(sas7bdat)
sas_data = read.sas7bdat("test.sas7bdat")
```

The best way to know about the separator symbol is to use a text editor such as Word or Pages to open up the data file you have before you import. Always remember to check your data set by using `str` which tells you much about your data set.
```{r}
str(table1)
```
And remember to check the header and the numbers of rows and columns because those are the places where things normally go wrong. (e.g. when you import a data set that has a header as if it doesn't, your data set will have an extra row of elements that are your original header.)
