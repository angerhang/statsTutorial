If you find any mistake or want to contribute, you are very welcome to open up an issue and point it out : )\r\n\r\nI will be updating on a weekly basis.\r\n\r\n#### Chapter I\r\n* [Basics](http://afxwilhelm.github.io/statsWithR/tutorials/basics.html)\r\n\r\n* [Data import](http://afxwilhelm.github.io/statsWithR/tutorials/dataImport.html)\r\n\r\n#### Chapter II Regression\r\n* [Simple Linear Regression I] (https://angerhang.shinyapps.io/linearR/)\r\n\r\n* [Simple Linear Regression II] (/statsWithR/tutorials/linearR_2.html)\r\n\r\n#### Chapter III Statistical Inference \r\n* [Statistical Testing] (/statsWithR/tutorials/statsTests.html)\r\n\r\n* [ANOVA] (/statsWithR/tutorials/anova.html)\r\n\r\n##### Text mining\r\nPart of my job at stats support is to explore the R packages that are related\r\nto text mining so here we go:\r\n\r\n* [Text mining overview](/statsWithR/tutorials/textMining.html)\r\nA brief introduction on what can we do with R for text mining tasks.\r\n\r\n* [Introduction to text mining package](/statsWithR/tutorials/textMiningIntro.html)\r\nWe dive into the text mining infrastructure of text mining in R and\r\nhave a focus on the use of package `tm`. \r\n\r\n* [Introduction to TwitteR](/statsWithR/tutorials/twitterR.html) A fun package that gives us access to Twitter's web API. We will do a naive analysis on Donald Trump's popularity in the end.\r\n\r\n* [Webmining](/statsWithR/tutorials/webMining.html) Use `tm.plugin.webmining` package to retrieve feeds from the web.\r\n\r\n* [RText](/statsWithR/tutorials/rtext.html) A package that contains 9 common supervised learnings such as SVM and neural network as a start-to-product tool. Great for prototyping and experimenting.\r\n\r\n### For data guru\r\nI have also composed something for Rhadoop and SparkR last semester. If you are keen to big data. These might be a good start.\r\n\r\n##### SparkR\r\n* [Intro-to-SparkR](/sparkR/intro)\r\n\r\n* [Linear and logistic regressions](/sparkR/regressions)\r\n\r\n\r\n##### Rhadoop\r\n* [Basics](https://github.com/angerhang/hadoopAndR)\r\n",
